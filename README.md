# Chernarus AI Base DMS Static Mission
Large AI Base objects &amp; Static DMS mission in the North of Chernarus. This is simply a mission file and objects file. Mods used are the CUP core,CUP maps and CUP Terrains CWA components.
Mission Created for a militarised server and has 2 roaming vehicles with the possibility of a Gorgon or armed Ifrit/Hunter/Strider so be ready for a hard fight.

Easy difficulty is configured for testing purposes and not intended for server deployment as it only has a small number of AI and a lot of loot. Medium difficulty is intended for small groups of 2-3, difficult for groups of 4 and hardcore as 5+ or just some very persistent smaller groups.

5 loot crates are configured;
- General items
- Building Supplies
- Sniper Rifles
- Medical supplies
- Special items (laser designators, rockets & launchers etc.)
Other than the first 2 crates, the others are fully customisable as to their contents with lists inside the mission file. You can also adjust the amount of loot in each crate if you want to make one particularly generous or another quite light.
